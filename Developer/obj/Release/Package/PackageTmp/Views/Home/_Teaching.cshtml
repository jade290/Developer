                            Teaching is a responsibility and a privilege. When teaching, as well as all things, I take my challenges
                            and provide solutions. The best part about teaching is when a student realizes they do not need the
                            instructor anymore. At this point, they recognize their resources, and accept the responsibility that is
                            learning. From then on, the sky is their only limit. They are unstoppable and their understanding knows
                            no bounds.

                                <p>
                                    NET 1025 is an introductory course in computer hardware. The emphasis will be on the basic
                                    installation of computer hardware and computer maintenance fundamentals. This course prepares
                                    students to take the CompTIA 220-801 exam.
                                    <br />
                                    The goal is for students to learn not only what computer components make up a PC but also what those
                                    components are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are
                                    likely to evolve in the future. We will draw examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered
                                    include: congestion/flow/error control, routing, addressing, naming, multi-casting, switching,
                                    internetworking, and network security. Evaluation is based on homework assignments, the projects,
                                    and two mid-term exams.
